## Contributing Code

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If you're looking to add a new feature, please check if a feature issue exists or create one before starting development.

When you've identified an issue and you want to work on it here's how you can get started:

1. Fork the repo
2. Setup project
   - If you using VS Code: Open the project in devcontainer mode
   - Or, setup your local env with `just setup`
3. Add your changes
4. Test your changes using `just lint` and `just -- import --csv imports/<filename.csv>` to make sure everything still works
5. Commit & push your changes (we suggest use a feature or fix branch)
6. Open a PR to get your changes merged.

### With Dev Container (Recommended)

1. Requirements: `Docker >=24`
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code
3. Install the Dev Containers extension
4. Reopen in container when prompted

### Without Dev Container

1. **Requirements**

   | pkg    | version  |
   | ------ | -------- |
   | Docker | `>=24`   |
   | Python | `>=3.12` |

2. **Check the project:**

   ```bash
   just setup
   ```

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature/fix
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure all CI checks pass

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the project's ESLint configuration

### How to add new project

1. Download csv from [tally.so](https://tally.so)
2. Save csv file into `imports/` directory (if doesn't exist create it)
3. Execute `just import --csv imports/<filename>`
4. Check and validate the output
5. Create a pull-request (It would be better to create a single MR for each project.)

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/import-projects-$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%s)
   git add .
   just test
   git commit -m "feat(awesome:projects): import projects"
   ```
6. When the pull request is closed, the workflow [sync-europeanopensource-eu.yml](.github/workflows/sync-europeanopensource-eu.yml) is triggered, which in turn activates a specific workflow on the [europeanopensource.eu](https://github.com/European-OpenSource/europeanopensource.eu) repository.
